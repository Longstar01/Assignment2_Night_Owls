        <p>I am Oguz Bastug. My student number is s3871348. I was born in Melbourne. But, I also spent time in Turkey when I was a child. I am currently studying IT at RMIT. I enjoy living in Melbourne. There are lots of opportunities here in terms of education and business. I like animals, nature, self-development, and cultural interactions. My hobbies are watching movies, jogging, fishing, playing soccer, and reading books. As an IT student I am interested in programming and software </<p>development. Although I do not have much programming or other IT experience, I will invest 3 years to learn.</p>

        <p>According to the Myers Briggs test, my character is ISTP which is The Problem Solvers. I am 33% introverted which includes being thought oriented, reserved, reflective, and observant, 49% of it is about sensing which includes being traditional, realistic, practical, detail oriented, 24% of it is about thinking which includes being logical, reasonable, level headed, values fairness and the last 19% is related to perceiving which includes being spontaneous, flexible, open minded, adventurous. According to the test, ISTPs are practical and observant, risk-takers, resourceful and adaptable, accepting and non-judgmental of others, intelligent, and excellent problem solvers.
          The result of the learning style test is like: Auditory; 20%, Visual; 55% and Tactile; 25%, so I am generally a visual learner. I prefer learning by reading and observing. I can understand and remember things by sight. I can picture what I am learning in my head and learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. I like to see what I am learning.
          Lastly, according to the 16 Personalities Test, my personality type is ENFJ-T which is a Protagonist. It means I am introverted and observant. It shows that I prefer thinking over my feelings, judging over being prospective and being turbulent rather than assertive.</p>

        <h2>IT Work</h2>
        <h3>Interview with an IT specialist  14/09/2020  19:30</h3>
        <h3>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
        <p>I am a Service delivery manager for a food manufacturing company. I am managing and supervising all the work to be done in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, New Zealand. I give infrastructure support, control servers and computers, applications, and all the programs that work the machinery. We set up and maintain them.</p>
        <h3>How long have you been doing this job?</h3>
        <p>I have been in my current position for 5 years. Overall, I have been working in the IT industry for about 20 years.</p>
        <h3>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
        <p>I work at a food manufacturing company which is FMCG. The company supports all the IT infrastructure and all the robotics. And, I am the service delivery manager for the company.</p>
        <h3>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
        <p>I manage teams. I deal with a lot of people, we have value production meetings and we have daily production operation meetings.</p>
        <h3>Who are all the different people you interact within your work? Please tell us about them.</h3>
        <p>I interact with people in the Quality department, they check the products. We work with communication companies like Telstra, HP, I also interact with the people in Cisco.</p>
        <h3>Do you also interact with construction companies?</h3>
        <p>When we are building a new site, Yes. In New Zealand, this is what we are doing now. I deal with vendors, we give them plans about how we want the cabling done, and all the cables going which data point and everything.</p>
        <h3>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
        <p>I manage a team of SEP specialists, infrastructure specialists, so these are the system administrators. Then, we have technicians, then we have system specialists, business analysts, and project managers. These are the people I deal with daily. This is our team.</p>
        <h3>Do you interact with customers as well?</h3>
        <p>No. Our customer is production. The business is our customer.</p>
        <h3>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
        <p>We deal with the board of directors, CEO, and CIO. They consult us for technical advice and our expertise. So, for example, they say we are going to build a factory in New Zealand, we are going to have 400 people working there. How many servers would we need, How many phones would we need, how many tablets, laptops and etc.</p>
        <h3>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
        <p>I spend most of the time managing people, talking to vendors, technicians, and so on.</p>
        <h3>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
        <p>Dealing with vendors is very challenging. Ensuring vendors keep to the SLAs (service level agreements) is very hard. So, when we engage a vendor, we say you look after these lines or these conveyors, as an example, that connect to the robots, if something breaks on that and our engineers call them, we need to ensure that this vendor when we sign the agreement that they will respond within 2 hours. That is the service level agreement. And they will get those lines fixed within 4 hours. We need to ensure that those vendors keep to service level agreements. That is the challenge. Because they will give you lots of excuses. And then, you just start escalating. Even with Telstra for example, someone will cut something somewhere, a fiber cable or something, and your service to the site is gone, SLA says within 8 hours my services will be restored, as an example, and it takes 12 hours and services are still not restored. That is the challenge.</p>
        <h3>Can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
        <p>I collect data for the product produced. I try to ensure that data for the product to be communicated to all areas and all machinery. For instance, I tell the system specialist that you look for a system, and tell SEP specialist that you take care of this and tell the technician you take care of this and tell the system administrator you take care of servers and they all collect data and send me, then I combine all the data and put them together for communication at the end.</p>
        <h3>What do you like about your job?</h3>
        <p>I like people, talking to people and exposure to technology I can say.</p>
        <h3>Finally, what do you suggest to the ones that want to work in the IT industry?</h3>
        <p>Keep up to date with the latest technology, practice, and learn from mistakes.</p>
        <p>My formal education has been through RMIT in the IT field. Having moved around particular areas of IT in the workforce ranging from - Web Design and Development, IT Solutions, Search Engine Optimisation, etc.</p>

			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
