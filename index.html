        <h3>Oguz Bastug</h3>
        <p>According to the Myers Briggs test, my character is ISTP which is The Problem Solvers. I am 33% introverted which includes being thought oriented, reserved, reflective, and observant, 49% of it is about sensing which includes being traditional, realistic, practical, detail oriented, 24% of it is about thinking which includes being logical, reasonable, level headed, values fairness and the last 19% is related to perceiving which includes being spontaneous, flexible, open minded, adventurous. According to the test, ISTPs are practical and observant, risk-takers, resourceful and adaptable, accepting and non-judgmental of others, intelligent, and excellent problem solvers.
          The result of the learning style test is like: Auditory; 20%, Visual; 55% and Tactile; 25%, so I am generally a visual learner. I prefer learning by reading and observing. I can understand and remember things by sight. I can picture what I am learning in my head and learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. I like to see what I am learning.
          Lastly, according to the 16 Personalities Test, my personality type is ENFJ-T which is a Protagonist. It means I am introverted and observant. It shows that I prefer thinking over my feelings, judging over being prospective and being turbulent rather than assertive.</p>

        <h2>IT Work</h2>
        <h3>Interview with an IT specialist  14/09/2020  19:30</h3>
        <h3>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
        <p>I am a Service delivery manager for a food manufacturing company. I am managing and supervising all the work to be done in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, New Zealand. I give infrastructure support, control servers and computers, applications, and all the programs that work the machinery. We set up and maintain them.</p>
        <h3>How long have you been doing this job?</h3>
        <p>I have been in my current position for 5 years. Overall, I have been working in the IT industry for about 20 years.</p>
        <h3>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
        <p>I work at a food manufacturing company which is FMCG. The company supports all the IT infrastructure and all the robotics. And, I am the service delivery manager for the company.</p>
        <h3>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
        <p>I manage teams. I deal with a lot of people, we have value production meetings and we have daily production operation meetings.</p>
        <h3>Who are all the different people you interact within your work? Please tell us about them.</h3>
        <p>I interact with people in the Quality department, they check the products. We work with communication companies like Telstra, HP, I also interact with the people in Cisco.</p>
        <h3>Do you also interact with construction companies?</h3>
        <p>When we are building a new site, Yes. In New Zealand, this is what we are doing now. I deal with vendors, we give them plans about how we want the cabling done, and all the cables going which data point and everything.</p>
        <h3>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
        <p>I manage a team of SEP specialists, infrastructure specialists, so these are the system administrators. Then, we have technicians, then we have system specialists, business analysts, and project managers. These are the people I deal with daily. This is our team.</p>
        <h3>Do you interact with customers as well?</h3>
        <p>No. Our customer is production. The business is our customer.</p>
        <h3>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
        <p>We deal with the board of directors, CEO, and CIO. They consult us for technical advice and our expertise. So, for example, they say we are going to build a factory in New Zealand, we are going to have 400 people working there. How many servers would we need, How many phones would we need, how many tablets, laptops and etc.</p>
        <h3>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
        <p>I spend most of the time managing people, talking to vendors, technicians, and so on.</p>
        <h3>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
        <p>Dealing with vendors is very challenging. Ensuring vendors keep to the SLAs (service level agreements) is very hard. So, when we engage a vendor, we say you look after these lines or these conveyors, as an example, that connect to the robots, if something breaks on that and our engineers call them, we need to ensure that this vendor when we sign the agreement that they will respond within 2 hours. That is the service level agreement. And they will get those lines fixed within 4 hours. We need to ensure that those vendors keep to service level agreements. That is the challenge. Because they will give you lots of excuses. And then, you just start escalating. Even with Telstra for example, someone will cut something somewhere, a fiber cable or something, and your service to the site is gone, SLA says within 8 hours my services will be restored, as an example, and it takes 12 hours and services are still not restored. That is the challenge.</p>
        <h3>Can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
        <p>I collect data for the product produced. I try to ensure that data for the product to be communicated to all areas and all machinery. For instance, I tell the system specialist that you look for a system, and tell SEP specialist that you take care of this and tell the technician you take care of this and tell the system administrator you take care of servers and they all collect data and send me, then I combine all the data and put them together for communication at the end.</p>
        <h3>What do you like about your job?</h3>
        <p>I like people, talking to people and exposure to technology I can say.</p>
        <h3>Finally, what do you suggest to the ones that want to work in the IT industry?</h3>
        <p>Keep up to date with the latest technology, practice, and learn from mistakes.</p>

        <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
          <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
          <p>as</p>
          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>The idea of machine learning comes from problems and difficulties that programmers have to solve or produce new algorithms to overcome these problems. If the problem is simple, it may not be hard for people to create algorithms. But, when it is a complex problem, it may take a long time to solve the problems and it may not be very accurate for the situation. The introduction of artificial intelligence now allows scientists and programmers to use a computer program to come up with   new algorithms. This is called machine learning. And the current technology allows us to have really smart robots and machinery which can use artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>Machine learning is basically the term given to the study of computers interacting with the outside world and coming up with new algorithms by itself. It focuses on experience to improve new algorithms then it uses that algorithms and uses data to have better experience and better algorithms. Machine learning is also called the study that allows the machines to bring up new algorithms without explicitly programmed. It is artificial intelligence that allows machines to be able to produce algorithms. Artificial intelligence can analyse big data very fast and it can give us more accurate outputs than people. So, we can say that machine learning is quicker and more accurate. It is this intelligence that allows the machine to make predictions and decide.</p>
          <p> When it comes to the environment where a computer program learns and how it learns, there are 3 main types of learning for the computer, although it is not restricted to these 3 types. First one is supervised learning. In the supervised learning, the computer is already given an input and shown which output to produce according to the input. Then, by this experience computer learn a general rule which it applies when mapping between inputs and outputs. And when it encounters with a different input it uses the rules that it already knows to produce the predicted outputs. Second type of learning is unsupervised learning. In the unsupervised learning, computer is not given any structure or rules. It is left with the environment alone and it is supposed to produce an algorithm by checking the inputs it has already got. So, this time the computer looks for pre-existing data which is not labelled or grouped. Then, the computer groups that data and tries to find a pattern according to the environment. Here is where the computer uses artificial intelligence. The third type of machine learning is reinforcement learning. Here, a computer is placed in an environment where it is supposed to do a certain task. Like the unsupervised learning, the computer is not given any pre-labelled data or structured data. Instead, computers are supposed to check pre-existing data and find a pattern to apply to the environment. It will, then, find some data and produce a pattern that it will compare with the environment. After comparing data and environment, it will find a balance and produce a new algorithm.</p>
          <p>As we are living in the robot era, artificial intelligence and machine learning definitely has a significant importance. We have already started using them. As an example, self-driving cars developed by using machine learning. Likewise, we search for something specific on the internet or when we watch a video on Youtube, the search engine will, then, suggest similar videos to watch or similar information to look for. We also get advantage of machine learning in the industries like banking, healthcare, retail and many more as a very strong alternative to the human brain. Now, it is inevitable that machine learning and artificial intelligence will introduce us more products to use in our homes, in education or in other areas.</p>
          <p>Machine learning will potentially impact our lives more in the near future. It already produced many robots, but these robots will be more common by the time.</p>
          <p>As people are slower than computers, computers will be able to produce more accurate products faster than humans. This means our problems will be solved faster and we would be able to produce better products. Until now, we used machinery to help us with labouring. Now, we can use computers to help us think, to help us solve problems and come up with new ideas. Literally, everything that happens in our environment can potentially change. However, it seems that
          machine learning is likely to change the technology and digital area mostly. It will produce new machinery to deal with our daily tasks such as lifting, cleaning and many more. It will also likely to produce smarter mobile phone applications, games and some other applications to help us with cybersecurity.</p>

          <p>Potentially, machine learning and AI will affect most of us positively and some of us negatively. If we start with the negative side, as the computers do more jobs in terms of thinking and labour, people do less work. It means we will work less and think less. So, computers are replacing human activity. New inventions may affect young people and students negatively leaving them less work and less thinking and that may make them lazy. On the other hand, AI will produce more accurate products for the working people like doctors, police, teachers, and other workers. It will also help the elderly in terms of daily tasks. It will potentially change many jobs. By having complex and smart machinery, labouring load may reduce. As long as a machine can do what people do, people will be doing less job and this will reduce their working hours. Also, people will need to deal with technology more to adapt themselves to the new applications. Potentially,
          there will be more need for the technicians, and for the programmers.</p>
          <p>In our daily lives, especially if we are using the technology frequently and if we are working, we will get most of the advantage of machine learning and AI. Because as discussed above, AI will potentially affect the technology mostly, so we will be using smarter applications and programs. It means our daily tasks will be done easily. Our problems will be solved faster. As computers will help programmers and developers to come up with more accurate software and algorithms. Especially, developers do lots of surveys to get feedback from users, and if we can adapt computers to the user experience environment, this will also be helpful in terms of correcting mistakes and developing better applications.</p>
          <p>I am personally very hopeful and curious about machine learning. Because, computers can now suggest very intelligent products to us which is fantastic. I hope, in the near future, I will be using smart home cleaners, better applications, fantastic cars which can adapt the drive according to road and weather conditions. On the other hand, I feel like my thinking activity is not as active as before now. Because, computers can suggest very smart options which are hard to reject which make me think less and act less.</p>
          <p>My family will definitely be affected by the improvements. For example, my brother is working in a construction company and if the computers can produce new machinery that can do what workers do, my brother may need to find another job, he may work less. Furthermore, my mother is getting older and in teen years she may not be able to do her house work, so if the computers can produce new home appliances, it will be perfect. So, I am hopeful and suspicious about what machine learning will come up with next.</p>

			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
